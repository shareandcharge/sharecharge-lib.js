======================
Share & Charge Library
======================

This is the Library for interacting with the Share & Charge EV Network. It can be implemented in a browser or server environment, for example by the Share & Charge CPO Core Client or by an eMobility Service Provider's mobile app.

----

Setup
-----

**Blockchain**

An Ethereum client should be running in the background. A popular choice for development and testing is ``ganache-cli`` because of its instant sealing, however `geth <https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/>`__ in development mode can also be used to provide conditions closer to a live environment (with Proof of Authority consensus and configurable block sealing times).

::

    npm install -g ganache-cli
    ganache-cli


**sharecharge-contracts**

The Share & Charge library depends on `sharecharge-contracts <https://github.com/motionwerkGmbH/sharecharge-contracts>`__. These are Ethereum smart contracts which enable the storing of Charing Poles on the Share & Charge EV network as well as interacting with them, for example, initiating charging sessions. This repository also provides a configuration for the aforementioned ``geth`` in development mode which can be run using ``npm run geth-dev``. The setup instructions for the smart contracts are as follows:

::

    git clone git@github.com:motionwerkGmbH/sharecharge-contracts.git
    cd sharecharge-contracts
    npm install
    truffle migrate


This should output the definitions of the contracts to ``$HOME/.sharecharge/contract.defs.<ENV>.json``. This file is necessary to run the library against the correct version of the smart contracts.

**sharecharge-lib**

::

    git clone git@github.com:motionwerkGmbH/sharecharge-lib.git
    cd sharecharge-lib
    npm install
    npm test

Assuming the tests passed, the library is now ready to interact with the Share & Charge EV Network.

API description
---------------

**Wallet**

To store stations, evses and request/confirm charging sessions on the network, it is necessary to first create an Ethereum wallet. This wallet needs to be funded with Ether in order to pay the blockchain's transaction fees.

A wallet can be generated using either a new or known 12 word seed phrase. This seed phrase allows a user to regain access to their wallet if they lose it.

*Example Usage (in TypeScript)*

.. code-block:: typescript

    import { Wallet } from 'sharecharge-lib';

    // generate new seed and keypair
    let newWallet = Wallet.generate();

    // get seed of new wallet
    newWallet.seed
    // 'maid left ostrich minor ask stomach outdoor vacuum beach admit dinner avoid'

    // get generated wallet object
    let wallet = newWallet.wallet
    wallet.keychain[0].address;
    // 0x6aded10b71224ca208f7476cebd72270771a451e

    // alternatively, generate from seed
    wallet = new Wallet('maid left ostrich minor ask stomach outdoor vacuum beach admit dinner avoid');

    wallet.keychain[0].address;
    // 0x6aded10b71224ca208f7476cebd72270771a451e

    // add new key to the keychain
    wallet.addKey('maid left ostrich minor ask stomach outdoor vacuum beach admit dinner avoid');
    // true

----

**ShareCharge**

The ``ShareCharge`` module is the entry point to the network, allowing the addition of stations and evses, as well as the requesting and confirming of EV charging sessions.

*Construction*

The module requires a configuration object which lets the library know how to interact with the Ethereum client, like so:

.. code-block:: typescript

    const config = {
        // stage corresponding to desired contract definitions in $HOME/.sharecharge
        stage: 'local',
        // RPC endpoint of the Etheruem client running in the background
        provider: 'http://localhost:8545',
        // gas price of the network
        gasPrice: 18000000000
    }

*Example Usage - Creating Stations and Evses*

.. code-block:: typescript

    import { ShareCharge, Station, Evse } from 'sharecharge-lib';

    const sc = new ShareCharge(config);
    const wallet = new Wallet('seed');


    // initialise new station
    const station = new Station();

    // set parameters
    station.latitude = 52.6743;

    // create the station on the network
    sc.stations.useWallet(wallet).create(station);

    // initialise new evse
    const evse = new Evse();

    // link the evse to the station
    evse.stationId = station.id;

    // create the evse on the network
    sc.evses.useWallet(wallet).create(evse);


*Example Usage - controlling EV charging sessions*

.. code-block:: typescript

    // find the evse on the network by its unique identifier
    sc.evses.getById(evseId).then(evse => {

        // request charge at the evse for 5 seconds
        sc.charging.useWallet(wallet).requestStart(evse, 5);

        // confirm to the network that the charge started
        sc.charging.useWallet(wallet).confirmStart(evse, addressOfDriver);

        // request stop at the evse
        sc.charging.useWallet(wallet).requestStop(evse);

        // confirm to the network that the charge stopped
        sc.charging.useWallet(wallet).confirmStop(evse, addressOfDriver);

        // notify network of error during charge session
        await sc.charging.useWallet(wallet).error(evse, controller, 1 /* error code*/);

    });


*Example Usage - listening to events*

.. code-block:: typescript

    // start the event listener
    sc.startListening();

    // listen for StationCreated events
    sc.on('StationCreated', callback);

    // listen for StartRequested events
    sc.on('StartRequested', async (request) => {

        // obtain values from StartRequested Event
        const evseId = request.evseId;
        const driver = request.controller;
        const secondsToRent = request.secondsToRent;

        // filter by evseId
        if (myListOfEvses.includes(evseId)) {

            // send a request to the charging pole to start the charge sesssion here

            // get evse object from network to use in the following request
            const evse = await sc.evses.getById(evseId);

            // if start was successful, send a confirmation to the network
            await sc.charging.useWallet(wallet).confirmStart(evse, controller);
        }

    });
